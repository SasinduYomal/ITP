          With brand-name water bottle fads and gallon-a-day water
          challenges trending on TikTok, hydration is in, and that’s good news
          for health. The average human body is more than 60% water. Water makes
          up almost two-thirds of your brain and heart, 83% of your lungs, 64%
          of your skin, and even 31% of your bones. It’s involved in almost
          every process that keeps you alive. So if you’ve hopped on the
          water-drinking bandwagon, you’re doing yourself a big solid.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Water is essential for your body’s survival,” says Crystal Scott,
          registered dietitian-nutritionist with Top Nutrition Coaching. “It
          helps regulate your temperature, transports nutrients, removes waste,
          lubricates your joints and tissues, and it also plays a crucial role
          in maintaining the delicate balance of electrolytes and fluids in your
          body.”
        </p>

        <p>
          You lose water when you breathe, sweat, urinate, and metabolize food
          and drink into energy. If you don’t replace that fluid, your health
          can go downhill, and fast. Without food, your body can keep ticking
          for as long as three weeks or more. But without water, you’ll die in
          only a few days. There’s just too many systems that depend on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I like to correlate our bodies with planet earth,” says Scott. “Our
          earth is made up of a large percentage of water. If that amount got
          too low, what would happen to our food systems? Our forests? Animal
          life? It’s a domino effect.”
        </p>

        <p>To keep that first domino from falling, she says, drink up.</p>

        <p>
          “It’s the starter when looking at any form of change or issues with
          your nutrition or your lifestyle—assess water intake first and
          foremost,” says Scott. “It helps with fullness cues, it can improve
          cognitive function, mood, physical performance, and can prevent health
          problems like constipation, kidney stones, and urinary tract
          infections. It’s one of the foundational building blocks.”
        </p>

          Bottom line: Water is life. But how much should you be downing daily
          not just to survive, but thrive?

        <h2>How many ounces of water should I drink a day?</h2>
        <p>
          The common rule of thumb you’ve likely heard is the 8×8 rule: Drink
          eight eight-ounce cups of water a day. If you’re achieving that,
          you’re doing well, says Scott. But it’s possible you could benefit
          from some adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t think that amount is necessarily wrong, but I think research
          over time has definitely evolved,” she says. “Water recommendations
          are going to vary depending on age, sex, and activity level.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Your intake recommendation may vary based on life circumstances too.
          For example, if you live in a hot and humid climate, get a lot
          of physical activity, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding, you may need
          more water daily than the average adult.  Your doctor can help guide
          you.
        </p>

        <p>
          The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine
          recommends an average daily water intake of about 125 ounces for men
          and about 91 ounces for women. If you’re not filling up a water
          bottle to exactly that amount every day, you’re probably still close
          or even over, because you also get water from food, says Scott.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You can get a lot of hydration from foods like celery, oranges,
          strawberries, watermelon, and cucumbers,” she says. “All are hydrating
          foods that can actually help supplement your water intake.”

        <h2>How much water is too much?</h2>
        <p>
          Although it’s rare, it is possible to drink too much water. It’s a
          condition called hyponatremia, and it happens when the amount of water
          in your system overwhelms your kidneys and they can’t keep up with a
          normal filtration rate. The sodium content of your blood becomes
          dangerously diluted and causes your cells to swell. Certain health
          conditions such as kidney failure and congestive heart failure put you
          at higher risk of it, and some high-level athletes may experience it
          if they don’t replace their electrolytes after exercising.

        <h2>How do I know if I’m drinking enough water?</h2>
        <p>
          For the majority of the population, the bigger issue is getting enough
          water. While it’s helpful to keep tabs on actual ounces, the best
          indicator of whether you’re well hydrated is your body. When you don’t
          get enough water, your body will show certain signs.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Urine color is a really great indicator of hydration status,” says
          Scott. If your toilet water is pale yellow or clear after you pee,
          you’re golden. Dark yellow or amber colored urine are signs your body
          needs fluids.
        </p>

        <p>
          Headaches, migraines, bad sleep, constipation, dizziness, and feeling
          lightheaded or confused can also be symptoms of dehydration. When in
          doubt, head to the spout.

        <h2>Tips for getting your daily fill</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re committing yourself to hydration optimization, Scott
          recommends starting slow. First take stock of where you are, and then
          set a goal for where you want to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Half your body weight in ounces is a great starting point,” she says.
          “So for someone who’s 200 pounds, our first goal would be 100 ounces.
          And let’s say they’re only drinking 20 ounces of fluid a day. So every
          week, we’d want to increase about eight to 10 ounces a week, slow and
          steady. Because if you do hydrate too quickly, people can feel really
          waterlogged.”
        </p>
        <h2>Other handy tips Scott suggests:</h2>
        <p>
          1.Experiment with drinking it ice-cold or adding sliced fruit to give it
          flavor. 
        </p>
        <p>
          2.Use smaller water bottles and refill them instead of filling a huge
          jug for the whole day, which can feel daunting to conquer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          3.Split your day into increments and give yourself a mini goal in each
          section. That way you’re keeping a steady stream of hydration going
          instead of trying to gulp it all in one go.
