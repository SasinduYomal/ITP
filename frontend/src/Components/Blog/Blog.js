        <h2>The Role of Water in the Human Body</h2>
        <p>
          According to an ancient Slovakian Proverb, “Pure water is the world’s
          first and foremost medicine.” Perhaps that explains why, simple as it
          is, water remains an entire class of food alongside proteins,
          carbohydrates, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constituting up to 60% of the human adult body, this liquid gold that
          sustains us is more than just a thirst quencher. In fact, every cell,
          organ, and tissue needs it to regulate temperature and perform bodily
          functions. Additionally, it acts as a nutrient and waste transporter
          and lubricator.{" "}

        <p>
          However, continue reading to truly understand the fascinating secrets
          of the water’s role in keeping us alive. In this article, we will
          extensively discuss the essential functions of water in the body and
          tips for staying hydrated.{" "}

        <p>Let’s dive in!</p>

        <h2>What are the functions of water in the body?</h2>

        <p>
          Water is essential in ensuring optimal bodily functions and overall
          sound health. Getting the right amount of fluids every day can prevent
          dehydration – a state that often causes disorganized thoughts, random
          mood swings, body overheating, constipation, and even kidney stones.
          Also, since H2O does not contain any calories, its regular consumption
          will ultimately help you control body weight.Regardless of how the body receives its fill, here are some other
            essential functions of body water
        </p>

        <p>
          1.Controls the internal body temperature through sweating and
          respiration
        </p>
        <p>
          2.It metabolizes and transports the carbohydrates and proteins our
          bodies use as food in the bloodstream;
        </p>
        <p>3.Forms saliva</p>
        <p>4.Moistens tissues in the eyes, nose, and mouth</p>
        <p>It lubricates joints</p>
        <p>
          It reduces the stress on the kidneys and liver by flushing out waste
          products

        <h2>Reasons and tips for drinking more water</h2>

        <p>
          Maintaining optimal health will require that you know: how much water
          to drink in a day? Though factors like climate, age, and physical
          activities may influence your body’s daily requirements, the bottom
          line is that you need to drink more water, and here are the reasons
          why:
        </p>

        <p>1. Improves brain performance</p>

        <p>
          According to the International Journal of Environmental Research and
          Public Health Research, dehydration could cause memory lag, distorted
          attention, and fatigue. So if you ever feel woozy, take a sip of
          water.To keep your brain at peak performance, set a daily intake goal
          to drink more water. You can employ the SMART goal method – Specific,
          Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound.For example, set a
          goal to drink 32 ounces daily and monitor your progress to stay
          motivated and eventually make it a habit.
        </p>

        <p>2. Encourages healthier eating</p>

        <p>
          A published study by Clinical Nutrition Research observed that H2O
          might help satisfy you, especially if you have some before a meal. At
          this rate, you can eat moderately and maintain a healthy body
          weight.Plus, you can optimize water importance in the body if you
          replace other drinks with sugars, like soda and sports drinks with
          regular clean water. That will help to reduce the chances of type 2
          diabetes or heart disease and calorie consumption.
        </p>
        <p>3. Protects your tissues, spinal cord, and joints</p>
        <p>
          Keeping your tissues, spinal cord, and joints moist is one of the
          functions of water to the body. With the recommended levels of
          hydration, these sensitive areas, including the blood, bones, and
          brain, can retain moisture for optimal performance. Water also acts as
          a “shock absorber” to protect the spinal cord and a lubricant for the
          joints.Additionally, adequate fluid consumption helps your kidneys
          remove waste through perspiration, urination, and defecation. Set
          reminders with an app, smartphone, or smartwatch alarm to ensure you
          get the required hydration level. For example, if you often lose track
          of your consumption, set a reminder to take a few sips every 45
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>4. Helps in healthy digestion</p>
        <p>
          Water is essential for healthy digestion, as it helps break down the
          food you eat. Its “stickiness,” otherwise known as surface tension,
          also aids in transporting these materials in the body. You can
          maximize the importance of water for the body by maintaining regular
          hydration, for instance, one glass before each meal. So, if you eat 3
          meals daily, it is an extra 3 cups for your daily consumption. You can
          add fruits like lemons, limes, oranges, cucumber, watermelon, or
          strawberries for that extra kick to the routine.
        </p>
        <p>5. Prevents dehydration</p>
        <p>
          According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, your body
          will lose extra fluids when you exercise, sweat excessively, or suffer
          a fever or illness that makes you vomit or stool. So, to recover from
          the excessive loss, always keep a filled bottle to drink on the go.
          This will encourage the required fluid intake. It also acts as a
          visual reminder to drink up whether you are running errands,
          traveling, or at home, work, or school.

        <h2>What type of water do you need to drink every day?</h2>
        <p>
          Even though there are various options to drink, including tap or
          filtered water, the tap option often contains unhealthy and dangerous
          contaminants and bacteria. So, continuous consumption puts you at risk
          of lead, pesticides, and chlorine poisoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, filtered water is safer and healthier, as the water
          filters for refrigerators and entire households significantly reduce
          these contaminants, thus improving the health of individual homes.
          Filtering also improves healthy, hydrated skin, nutrient absorption,
          detoxification, and improved digestion.{" "}
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Is filtered water good for your body? </h2>

        <p>
          Filtered H2O is good for the body as it can help remove 99% of the
          contaminants found in tap water, including metals like arsenic, lead,
          copper, and iron, industrial and pharmaceutical byproducts such as
          pesticides or hormones, chlorine and chloramine, sediments, and
          particulates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filtering your water significantly reduces your chances of developing
          various types of cancer and diseases caused by toxic overload in the
          body. It also improves the importance of water in the body, as it is
          vital to reducing pollutants and enhancing nutrient and mineral
          absorption in our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, regular hydration will work wonders on your skin. Unlike H2O
          with chlorine that rids your hair and skin of its natural oils,
          showering in filtered water will leave you with shinier hair, stronger
          nails, and softer skin. So, before you invest in expensive, corrective
          cosmetic products, install a reliable water filter in your home to
          provide your skin with the ideal condition to glow.
